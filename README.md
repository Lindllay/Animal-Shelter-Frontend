<h4>This project was created to consolidate coding skills using the MERN stack. It is an implementation of an animal shelter website with access to the administration panel to manage the content.</h4>

<li>View news related to the shelter and access their details;</li>
<li>Access to sub-pages such as "how to help", "about us" and "contact us".</li>
</ul>

<li>Possibility to login to the panel as a test account - with limited privileges (without CRUD operations)</li>
<li>View the contents of the database (added animals and articles)</li>
<li>Execute operations such as adding and deleting both animals and articles (synchronization with mongoDB + Cloudinary)</li>
<li>View graphically represented statistics of animals currently in the shelter (using Recharts library);</li>
<li>Form validations while adding new animal or article if fields are missed or incorrect (using formik library);</li>
<li>Keep track of logged user, even after refreshing the browser</li>
</ul>

<h5>The graphic design was created entirely by me. Layout is optimalized for the app depending on device's screen size</h5>

Built with:
<strong> MERN stack, SCSS (CSS modules), formik, Recharts, , Figma</strong>
