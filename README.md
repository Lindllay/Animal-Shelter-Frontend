</ul>

<h4>Administration panel features:</h4>
  <ul>
<li>Logging into the administration panel - with username and password validation;</li>
<li>Possibility to login to the panel as a test account - with limited privileges (without CRUD operations)</li>
<li>View the contents of the database (added animals and articles)</li>
<li>Execute operations such as adding and deleting both animals and articles (synchronization with mongoDB + Cloudinary)</li>
<li>View graphically represented statistics of animals currently in the shelter (using Recharts library);</li>
<li>Form validations while adding new animal or article if fields are missed or incorrect (using formik library);</li>
